# MatrixMultiplier
VHDL project for Electronic Systems' exam

The project goal is to define a VHDL description of a system that could compute the multiplication between two matrices. Starting from a matrix A (NxM) and a matrix B (MxP) made of 4-bit two's complement numbers, we want to obtain a matrix C (NxP) made of Q-bit two's complement numbers, where Q must be choosen in order to avoid finite arithmetic errors
